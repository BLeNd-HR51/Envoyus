I have over 50 complete genuine (not reprints) Harpers Weekly Illustrated Newspapers for sale, at Miles Antique Mall. These very rare newspapers are all over 150 years old. They are in super condition as they had been bound for a university library most of their lives. They were sold at auction, and from there I was able to obtain some. Many are priced $48.00 and then a few less but most under $60. However I also have the April 1865 Newspaper with John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of Lincoln....that one is very rare and rather pricy. A great historic find, and the perfect gift for that very hard to please father or grand father..........not to mention the ladies who enjoy history. Most of these newspapers are 14 or 16 pages, they are filled with dozens of engraved prints, the center page is usually one extra large engraving. This is before color printing, so they are all B&W. ANY OF MY NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES may be inspected (AT THE COUNTER) after you pay for them.

The eye-catching design draws inspiration from stealth fighters, presenting an ergonomically-inclined surface for greater comfort during long gaming sessions. The large display provides wide viewing angles of up to 140 degrees for spectacular visuals, features a matte anti-glare coating to eliminate annoying reflections, and looks great in all light conditions. That translates into no eye strain and yet again more comfort for gamers. The G750JM's ergonomic keyboard angling goes easy on your hands and wrists, eliminating fatigue so you can go on having fun.

The PIXMA PRO-100 Wireless1 Professional Inkjet Printer possesses the functionality and technology you need to achieve high-quality output so your prints can look as good as the images you capture. The 8-ink dye based ChromaLife 100+ system provides you with an amazing color gamut so your prints will look as vivid as you remember. \n \nThe PIXMA PRO-100 shares technology with the rest of the PIXMA PRO line utilizing the Optimum Image Generating System to ensure what you envision is exactly what you get. The OIG System analyzes each area of the print and chooses the best ink mixture so you see the colors you expect to see in your print. \n \nThe new Print Studio Pro2 plug-in software makes it even easier to get amazing results from your favorite photo applications. Add to that connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Ethernet and USB and you have a professional machine that easily fits into your workflow that you can place anywhere around the studio. \n \nFor media support, the PIXMA PRO-100 features two paper trays. A rear tray for a variety of fine art and glossy photo papers, and a manual slot for thicker media to meet your printing needs. \n \nPrint your Vision up to 13\" x 19\": Print professional quality photos on various media up to 13\" x 19\". \n \nProfessional Quality, Built-in: Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) features a patented print head that enables printing with microscopic droplets and high resolution up to 4800 x 2400 dpi.4 \n \nTrue Monochrome Prints: The 3 monochrome inks which are part of the 8-ink ChromaLife 100+ system3 consist of Black, Gray, and Light Gray. These inks deliver enhanced, deep black density to raise your level of professional print quality when creating the dramatic expression of grayscale photography. \n \nOptimum Analysis and Mixture of Color: The Optimum Image Generating (OIG) System utilizes two major technologies that were first introduced in the PIXMA PRO-1. The first is a sophisticated mixing balance of inks determined from numerous ink combinations and advanced analysis. During this analysis, the OIG System carefully calculates the best results for each print mode and paper type used while looking at various image factors including color reproduction, tonal gradations, black density, low graininess, glossiness, anti-bronzing and anti-metamerism. These critical ink balancing principles are derived from Canon's expertise in imaging technology, as well as the familiar colors of life that people see and remember on a daily basis. The second is the balancing of color reproduction, tonal gradations, and uniform glossiness. The genius and power of the OIG System is truly showcased when your image is printed, exhibited, and is seen exactly as you envisioned it. \n \nPro Printing: The powerful Print Studio Pro plug-in software2 provides professional photographers effective printing solutions and can directly hand-over image data. Print Studio Pro is compatible with Digital Photo Professional (ver 2.1 or later), Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae CS, Adobe\u00ae Photoshop Elements\u00ae, and Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae Lightroom\u00ae. \n \nVersatile Paper Handling: Two-way paper feeding provides a rear tray for most supported media types and a dedicated manual feed in the back of the printer for easy loading of thicker papers. \n \nBuilt-in CD and DVD Printing: Conveniently print onto your printable CD, DVD or Blu-ray Discs and jackets. \n \nBuilt-in Wi-Fi: The built-in Wi-Fi1 gives you the freedom to place the printer where it's convenient and allows multiple users to seamlessly print from several computers. \n \nBuilt-in Ethernet Connectivity: The built-in Ethernet port allows multiple users to seamlessly print from several networked computers in any environment. \n \nComputer-free Printing: A PictBridge connection lets you print photos directly from your compatible digital camera, DV camcorder, or camera phone. \n \nHi-Speed USB: Plug the cable into your PC for a super-fast connection for your data transfers. \n \nAirPrint: Enables you to print photos, email, Web pages and documents from your Apple device directly to your printer - without installing a driver. \nExpert Review \n \nCanon launched its innovative PIXMA Pro-100 printer at Photokina, the world's leading imaging fair, in 2012. It is an entry-level model in Canon's PIXMA Pro series of A3+ desktop printers. This printer has been designed specially for photography enthusiasts. The Canon Pro-100 is the successor of PIXMA Pro 9000 Mark II and comes with a re-jigged ink set and support for ICC profiles. This printer uses the same ChromaLife 100+ inks, just like its predecessor. EOS-inspired design with reliable performance and exceptional image quality make this the most preferred printer among the Canon series of printers. \nBuild and ergonomics \n \nThe Canon PIXMA Pro-100 has a design similar to the Pro 9000 Mark II. Apart from that, the Pro-100 and Pro-10 are identical in size and use similar paper feeds. It is a large printer that weighs about 20 kg. The output tray is on the front of this printer while two feed-in trays are placed on the back. It has a storage compartment just below the front panel. It is a 13 x 19 printer that uses Canon's ChromaLife 100+ inks. \nFeatures \n \nThe Canon PIXMA Pro-100 wireless professional inkjet photo printer features a 4800 x 2400 dpi resolution with Canon's FINE technology. Canon's Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) technology features a patented print head that allows the photographers to print with microscopic droplets. This printer, with its 8-cartridge ink system, provides a wide color range that includes three black inks for high quality black and white photos. It enables the photographers to get borderless prints of up to 13 x 19\". It is compatible with various kinds of prints, including glossy, lustre, matte photo paper, museum etching and other fine art papers. This printer allows the photographers to print directly on CD, DVD, Blu-ray discs or even on customizable discs and jackets. \n \nThe Canon PIXMA Pro-100 wireless printer is efficient enough to print an 8.0 x 10\" image within just 51 seconds! It uses true monochrome inks that include colors such as black, light grey and grey as a part of the 8-ink ChromaLife 100+ system. These inks deliver deep black density that enhances the level of professional print quality for grey scale photography. \n \nThe Canon Pro-100 wireless printers are equipped with the Optimum Image Generating (OIG) system that utilizes two major technologies. The first technology uses a sophisticated balance of inks that is determined through numerous ink combinations and advanced analysis. The second technology includes balancing of color reproduction, tonal gradations and uniform glossiness. \nPerformance \n \nThe Canon PIXMA Pro-100 uses dye-based ChromaLife inks instead of the pigment inks. Most A3+ printers such as Canon's Pro-10, Pro-1 and Epson's R2000 use pigment inks. Dye-based inks offer many benefits over pigment inks. It can easily soak the ink into the paper thus making the ink look bright, smooth and glossy. That is why the Pro-100 photo prints turn out to be vibrant even with default print settings. The photo prints exhibit fine details with a glossy finish, with the delicate areas of contrast highlighted. It is popular among amateur photographers who want hassle-free printing. But it is also the best choice for professional photographers who need support for color profiles. \nConnectivity \n \nThe PIXMA Pro-100 features multiple connectivity options that enable the photographers to print using different devices. This printer comes with an inbuilt Wi-Fi that allows photographers to print effortlessly from multiple computers. It also offers a built-in Ethernet port that allows multiple users to print from computers in different networks. This wireless printer is equipped with Hi-Speed USB that allows the plug-and-play facility for faster data transfer from the computer. Its AirPrint function allows the users to print photos, e-mail, webpages and documents directly from a MacBook, iPhone or iPod Touch to the printer without the need to install drivers. It also allows photographers to conveniently print directly on a printable CD, DVD and Blu-ray discs. This printer comes with the PictBridge software application that enables users to print photos directly from a compatible DV camcorder, digital camera or mobile phone. \nConclusion \n \nThe Canon PIXMA Pro-100 is a large wireless printer that allows the photographers to print high quality photos easily. It delivers professional quality photo prints, mostly in grey scale photography. This entry-level model of Canon's PIXMA Pro series is ideal for amateur as well as professional photographers. It is perfect for enthusiast photographers who prefer printing photos on glossy paper. \n    ", "imageUrls": ["https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_jwNmYlFkM3o_600x450.jpg", "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_1PJ1qDI75Nr_600x450.jpg"], "lat": null, "lng": null, "postId": "5947593538", "postingUrl": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/ele/5947593538.html", "postDate": "2017-01-05T22:56:46-0800", "updateDate": null, "attributes": "", "locAccuracy": "low", "sellerName": null, "sellerPhoneNumber": null, "sellerEmail": null, "scrapeDate": "2017-01-11 18:18:51.677948", "specs": {}, "processingStatus": "fresh"},

I have the box/materials, but unfortunately due to an odd circumstance I won't have those until the 26th of this month. \n \nLet me know if you are interested/have any questions! \n \nLooking to sell for cash OR trade for a macbook air/macbook pro, +/- some cash.   \n \nCheers! Text or email, please.
