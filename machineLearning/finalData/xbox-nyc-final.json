Adult owned and played and in amazing condition. Comes with everything you need to be up and running in a heartbeat. I upgraded to a Playstation 4 so I don't need this baby any more but we had some good times and I'm hoping s/he will find a loving home. \n \nComes with: \n \n- Console 20GB white \n- 2 controllers in good condition (stick a little worn but otherwise each works great) \n- USB wireless adapter for WiFi \n- Power cable \n- Component cables \n- Headset with microphone (fuzzy ear thing missing) \n- A bunch of AA batteries for ya \n- Nine games: Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain, Grand Theft Auto 5, Battlefield 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, SSX, Far Cry 4, Spec Ops: The Line, Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, Catherine \n \nWorks perfectly. I've never had any issue and you won't either. It's rock solid - purchased in 2010 so it was late in the Xbox 360 release cycle so Microsoft had worked out all the issues.
