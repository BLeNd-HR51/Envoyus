They replaced the entire display because the screen was defective AND they replaced the logic board at the same time. \n \nBasically, that turned this into a brand new machine, except for the SSD and a couple very small dings on the corner.

Everything is working perfectly including all ports and peripherals like camera, microphone, bluetooth and keyboard.

Apple reports that this battery design increases runtime, and as a result, this model provides \"up to\" 7 hours compared to 5 hours for the model itreplaced. \n \nThis model is configured with a 45 nm \"Penryn\" 2.26 GHz Intel \"Core 2 Duo\" processor (P7550) -- with two independent processor \"cores\" on a single silicon chip -- a 3 MB shared \"on chip\" level 2 cache, a 1066 MHz frontside bus, 2 GB of 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-8500) installed in pairs (two 1 GB modules), a 250 GB Serial ATA (5400 RPM) hard drive, and an 8X DL \"SuperDrive\". It also features a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M \"graphics processor with 256 MB of SDRAM shared with main memory\" and a 13.3\" widescreen TFT active-matrix LED-backlit \"glossy\" display (1280x800 native resolution). \n \nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports, a single audio in/out port, and a Mini DisplayPort that supports an external display at 2560x1600. \n \nProcessor \n \n Core 2 Duo 2.26GHz \n \nHard Drive \n \n 250GB \n \nMemory \n \n 2GB \n \nWi-Fi? \n \n Yes \n \nDisk Drive \n \n DVDRW \n \nOperating System \n \nMac OS X 10.9, Mavericks \n \nBattery \n \n Holds a charge-Normal \n \nNote: \n \n \n    ","imageUrls":[],"postId":"5949726878","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/clt/5949726878.html","postDate":"2017-01-07T12:41:57-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"Apple Macbook 6,1 13.3 inches","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/clt/5949726878","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:04.364039","specs":{"condition":2,"Screen Size":["13.3 ''","13.3-inch","13.3 ''","13","13-Inch","''","''","''","''","''","''","''","''","''","''","''","''","13.3 ''","''"],"RAM":["2GB","8x","2GB","4GB","8x","8x","8x","8x","8x","8X DL ``","2GB"],"Hard Drive":["250GB","250GB","256MB","250 GB","256 MB","250GB"],"Year":["2010","2.1","885909345915","2","2009","2.26","Late 2009","Mini"],"Graphics":["nVIDIA GeForce 9400M Graphics","graphics","internal","ID","Interface","NVIDIA GeForce 9400M","Input","MB","NVIDIA GeForce 9400M `` graphics","includes"],"Processor":["Type Intel Core 2 Duo","2.26GHz","4.7","Core 2 Duo","2.26GHz"]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":2,"location":{"lat":37.318,"lon":-122.0449}}

In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \n \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up; an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel. \n \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \n \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode.

It has the following specs: \n \n1.86Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor \n2GB RAM \n256GB SSD Drive \nNvidia GeForce 320M 256MB GPU \nMac OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 \nSD Card Reader \nWebcam \n2 USB Ports \n1 Mini Display Port \n1 Magsafe AC Adapter \n \nCondition: \n \nThe laptop exterior and keyboard is in excellent cosmetic condition with minimal scuffs and virtually no dents.  The screen has a few small bright spots but otherwise in good condition.  The battery is currently at a cycle count of 728 and will probably need to be replaced soon although it still holds a charge and will last a couple of hours under normal use.  Lastly, the audio on the laptop is not functioning.  The internal speakers as well as the headphone jack do not work however, when connected to a bluetooth speaker, the sound works fine.  I believe the problem is the small headphone/audio board but cannot confirm without a replacement.  I will include a small cube bluetooth speaker with the laptop and can demonstrate the audio functionality with the external speaker.  Bluetooth headphones will work as well without issue.  Overall, the laptop functions well and would be a great machine for a student or someone that needs a good laptop for a good price. \n \nFirst $250 takes this laptop home.

{"title":"2012 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display for Sale! Comes with Extras!","price":700,"priceUnit":"$","cityName":"fairfield / vacaville","description":"\n         \nHello Craigslist, \n \nI have a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro for sale. Here's a quick list of the specifications for it: \n \n-MacOSX Sierra  \n-Retina display: 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors \n-2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \n-8GB of 1600MHz DDR3L onboard memory \n-256GB Harddrive \n-Intel HD Graphics 4000 \n-NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching \n-MagSafe 2 power port \n-Two Thunderbolt ports (up to 10 Gbps) \n-Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps) \n-HDMI port \n-Headphone port \n-SDXC card slot \n-802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking;3 IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible \n-Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \n-Stereo speakers \n-Dual microphones \n-Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys (inverted \"T\" arrangement) with ambient light sensor \n-Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control; supports inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities \n \nFor any other questions about the specifications, you can find them at the Apple page here: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp653?locale=en_US \n \nI have always kept the laptop in a hard shell case which will come with it. The hard shell case is a little beat up and due to some dust and other things getting in it, the bottom of the MacBook Pro does have some minor scratches on it. However, the inside and top of the MacBook Pro are perfect and show no signs of wear. I've only ever used the laptop for photography work and have just recently upgraded to a desktop so I'm looking to sell my Macbook Pro.  \n \nThe laptop comes with a brand new charger that was bought very recently for it. I also have the original box and manuals for it too. \n \nI'm asking $700 firm for everything and will not go any lower so please do not ask. I'm also not interested in any trades so again, please don't ask. \n \nI'm actually located in Sacramento, but for anyone coming from the Bay Area, I'm willing to meet in Vacaville, but no farther than that. And we'll meet at a local Starbucks so that you can test the wifi and anything else you'd like on it.  \n \nSo, If you've got $700 cash in hand and are willing to drive to me and meet in person, then please feel free to email me or, preferably, text me at 916-Eight-Three-Three-9530. Thanks and have a nice day!

Please see some more detailed specifications and attached pictures below! \n \n\"The MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.2 15-Inch (Early 2011/Thunderbolt) features a 32 nm \"Sandy Bridge\" 2.2 GHz Intel \"Core i7\" processor (2720QM), with four independent processor \"cores\" on a single silicon chip, a 6 MB shared level 3 cache, 8 GB of 1333 MHz DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-10600) installed in pairs (two 2 GB modules), a 500 GB Serial ATA (5400 RPM) hard drive, an 8X DL \"SuperDrive\", dual graphics processors -- an AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory and an Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics processor that shares 384 MB of memory with the system -- and an integrated FaceTime HD webcam. \n \nThe standard configuration of this model has an LED-backlit 15.4\" widescreen TFT active-matrix \"glossy\" display (1440x900 native resolution), but it also was available via custom configuration with a \"high-resolution glossy\" 1680x1050 display and a \"high-resolution antiglare\" 1680x1050 display for an additional US$100 and US$150, respectively. \n \nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, Gigabit Ethernet, a Firewire \"800\" port, two USB 2.0 ports, separate audio in and out ports, an SDXC card slot, and a new \"Thunderbolt\" port that is backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort and, likewise, supports an external display at 2560x1600 and passes an audio signal. Thunderbolt also supports other peripherals that use the Thunderbolt standard which provides up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth in both directions.\" \n \n \nI'm asking for a strict $500 CASH ONLY offer, with the ability to meet me at a nearby public space.

This is a genuine Apple product \n \n$50 \n \nLeave a phone number \n \nThe 85 Watt MagSafe Power Adapter features a magnetic DC connector that ensures your power cable will disconnect if it experiences undue strain and helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection. \nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector will light; an amber light lets you know that your portable is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives users an even easier and more compact way to travel. \nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage. \nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery. \nCompatible with 15- or 17-inch MacBook Pro. \n    ","imageUrls":[],"postId":"5954229635","postingUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sys/5954229635.html","postDate":"2017-01-10T19:28:09-0800","updateDate":null,"attributes":"","locAccuracy":"high","sellerUrl":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/reply/sfo/sys/5954229635","sellerName":null,"sellerPhoneNumber":null,"sellerEmail":null,"scrapeDate":"2017-01-13 07:47:28.684054","specs":{"condition":0,"Graphics":["if","if"],"Screen Size":["15-","17-inch"],"Processor":[""],"Hard Drive":[""],"RAM":[""],"Year":[""]},"processingStatus":"fresh","condition":0,"location":{"lat":37.3492,"lon":-121.953}}
